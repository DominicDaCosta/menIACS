Our ultimate goal was to create a Machine Learning model that traverses a Virginia GDP/population data set and identify the cities
with the highest possibility of becoming new populous cities within the state, alongside the likes of Arlington and
Loudoun County, with the hopes of low-income families moving to new vibrant cities before prices drastically increase.
This project could help families, real estate owners and growing small businesses/tech companies. When moving into
Virginia for the first time, families could see if thereâ€™s an emergence of a certain city to raise a family in.
