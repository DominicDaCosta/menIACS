Our ultimate goal was to create a Machine Learning model that traverses a Virginia GDP/population data set and identify the cities
with the highest possibility of becoming new populous cities within the state, alongside the likes of Arlington and
Loudoun County, with the hopes of low-income families moving to new vibrant cities before prices drastically increase.
This project could help families, real estate owners and growing small businesses/tech companies. When moving into
Virginia for the first time, families could see if there’s an emergence of a certain city to raise a family in. If we could tell
what the next big city is, typically housing prices also increase and this would be beneficial to real estate owners. This
same reasoning applies to helping growing small businesses/tech companies as they seek to be near heavily populated
areas for more business. In conclusion, the motivation for this project also benefits Virginia as a whole, as we will
hopefully see a growth in popularity of larger cities/counties leading to other cities’/counties’ economic success.
